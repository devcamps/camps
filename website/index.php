<h1>Your web development process is broken!</h1>

<p>Make it better with DevCamps, a system for easily managing “camps” — environments for development, integration, staging, and production.</p>

<p>Camps make developers more efficient and projects run more effectively. Developers and business users can collaborate in real time.</p>

<p>DevCamps are supported by <a href="http://www.endpoint.com/">End Point</a> and are<br />in use for projects large and small.</p>
